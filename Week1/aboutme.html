        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Cameron, and I'm a fourth year Environmental Science Major with minors
            in Digital Humanities and Environmental Systems and Society. I'm from Seattle, WA, and 
            aside from LA have also lived in Singapore. I love being outdoors: <i>camping, hiking, swimming,</i>
            you name it. I also love ultimate frisbee, and play for UCLA.
            
            I am <b>so</b> excited to work and learn with you 
            all this quarter! </p>

        <p>I'm really excited about this class! I know <i>very little </i> about coding, but am super 
            pumped to learn. One of my biggest goals by the end of this course is to feel comfortable 
            with the basic elements of coding, and to feel like even if I don't know how to specifically
            code something, that I would know how to go about learning and finding the answers.
            I do have some experience with mapping, specifically Arc and QGIS. I
            am excited to put these two skills together and make some cool maps from coding!</p>

        <h4>Ultimate Frisbee</h4>
        <p>I can and will talk your ear off about Ultimate Frisbee. You all should definitely join the team at 
            UCLA -- it is a great community and an absolute blast. A lot of folks haven't heard of or played frisbee
            before, so here's a rundown of the 2 main positions in the game and what they entail:</p>

        <ol>
                <li><b>Cutter</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cutters do a lot of the running. They'll often generate a lot of distance,
                            get thrown to, and then throw the disc to a handler.
                        </li>
                        <li>Probably more tiring, since you're running longer distances.</li>
                        <li>Pro: You get the glory of scoring.</li>
                        <li>Con: You have to run fast in order to score it and running is tough sometimes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Handler</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Handlers do a lot of the throwing, of moving the disc.</li>
                        <li>Pro: You get to throw it really far which is fun.</li>
                        <li>Con: If you throw it poorly, or if the defender blocks your throw, it's 
                            a big bummer.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
